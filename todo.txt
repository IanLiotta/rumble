add sprites

Make enemies turns resolve in order instead of all at once
    add a struct TurnQueue {pub queue: VecDeque<Legion::Entity>}
    load it as a resource
    rewrite systems to operate on front of queue instead of searching for all matching entities
    on end turn, check for outstanding IsMoving messages. If none, pop entity and push it on the back
    Switch game state to player or enemy turn, depending on who's in front of the queue
